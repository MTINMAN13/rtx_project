(notes to self:) Key Takeaways for Machine Learning:

    Feature Engineering and Feature Selection:
        Distance calculations for creating new features.
        Normalization and scaling of data.

    Machine Learning Algorithms:
        K-means Clustering: Uses Euclidean distances for grouping.
        K-nearest Neighbors (KNN): Relies on distance measurements.
        Support Vector Machines (SVM): Uses geometry and distances for decision boundaries.

    Dimensionality and Dimensionality Reduction:
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Utilizes geometric relationships.
        t-SNE and UMAP: Uses distances for data visualization in lower dimensions.

    Real-world Applications:
        Computer Vision: Object detection, 3D reconstruction.
        Natural Language Processing (NLP): Similarity measurements in embedding spaces.

    Optimization and Performance:
        K-means++ initialization: Improved cluster initialization for faster convergence.

Practical Steps:

    Implement Algorithms: Practice implementing distance-based algorithms like KNN and K-means.
    Data Visualization: Use graphical tools to visualize data in different dimensions.
    Competitions: Participate in Kaggle competitions to apply these concepts on real datasets.
